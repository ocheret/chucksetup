#If you're going to build Homebrew formulae from source that link

#case if you are a developer of such a formula, or if you have an
#EOL version of MacOS for which prebuilt bottles are no longer
#provided and you are using such a formula).
#
#To avoid them accidentally linking against a Pyenv-provided Python,
#add the following line into your interactive shell's configuration
